# Scientific Calculator Project

This project is a **Scientific Calculator** application that allows users to perform a wide range of mathematical operations across different number systems (decimal, binary, and hexadecimal).
It supports basic arithmetic operations, scientific calculations, and bitwise operations. The calculator also provides advanced functions like square root, square, reciprocal, and bitwise manipulations, while seamlessly converting numbers between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal formats.

## Features

- **Basic Mathematical Operations**: 
  - Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (ร), Division (รท).
  - Square (sqr), Square Root (sqrt), Reciprocal (1/x).
  
- **Advanced Scientific Functions**: 
  - Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
  - Logarithmic functions (log, ln).
  
- **Bitwise Operations**: 
  - AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~).
  - Left Shift (<<), Right Shift (>>).
  
- **Number System Conversion**:
  - Perform calculations in **Decimal**, **Binary**, or **Hexadecimal**.
  - Supports bidirectional conversion between number systems.

## Usage

1. **Enter Numbers**:
   - Type the number in the input field.
   - Select the number system (decimal, binary, hexadecimal) using the corresponding radio button.
   
2. **Select Operations**:
   - Choose a mathematical or scientific operation by clicking the relevant button (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `sqr`, `log`, `sin`, etc.).
   - For bitwise operations, select operations like `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, etc.
   
3. **Perform Calculation**:
   - Press the equals (`=`) button to get the result of the calculation.
   - The result is shown in the selected number format (binary, decimal, hexadecimal).
   
4. **Clear Input**:
   - Press the `C` button to clear the input field for new calculations.
